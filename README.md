# 🧮 Simple Python Calculator

## 📌 Project Description
This project is a simple calculator application written in Python.  
It allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations such as:

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)

The program asks the user to enter two numbers and choose an operator.  
It then calculates and displays the result. The calculator also prevents division by zero and continues running until the user decides to exit.
